# cashbook-macro
LibreOffice/OpenOffice macro for cash book

This macro is written for use in LibreOffice or OpenOffice. Given a properly formatted .ods file (having the rigth columns with validated data), upon running it prepares a cash book table which can then be printed or manually copied into the Intermittent Cash Book (Időszaki pénztárjelentés) ready to be submitted to the tax authorities.

The macro sums incomes and expenses, splits invoice numbers into text and number parts and amassess numbers which are in sequence. It also properly displays pagination as required by the standard Hungarian cahs book format and calculates carry overs.
